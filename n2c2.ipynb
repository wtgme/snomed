      "\n",
      "After several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs 60s/30s .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures .\n",

      "However , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .\n",
      "\n",
      "A swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure .\n",
      "\n",
      "He also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .\n",
      "\n",
      "It was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .\n",
      "\n",
      "At discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .\n",
      "\n",
      "His dry weight is 70.4 kg .\n",
      "\n",
      "Ischemia\n",

      "Rhythm\n",

      "\n",
      "He is on Amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .\n",
      "\n",
      "His underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .\n",

      "\n",
      "Likely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .\n",
      "\n",
      "He had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .\n",

      "\n",
      "This acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .\n",
      "\n",
      "His CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .\n",
      "\n",
      "All sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .\n",

      "Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter .\n",
      "\n",
      "Echocardiogram showed moderate dilated left atrium , no atrioseptal defect , severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe left ventricular systolic function and moderately dilated right ventricle .\n",
      "\n",
      "There was global hypokinesis apical throughout the right ventricle and abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular volume overload .\n",
      "\n",
      "Moderate to severe 3+ mitral regurgitation and 3+ tricuspid regurgitation along with moderate pulmonary early systolic hypertension .\n",
      "\n",
      "Of note , this echocardiogram was performed when the patient was tachycardiac .\n",
      "\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .\n",
      "\n",
      "However , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .\n",
      "\n",
      "It was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .\n",
      "\n",
      "Chest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .\n",
      "\n",
      "An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .\n",
      "\n",
      "Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .\n",
      "\n",
      "Again seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .\n",
      "\n",
      "It was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .\n",
      "\n",
      "He fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .\n",
      "\n",
      "His neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .\n",
      "\n",
      "A computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy .\n",

      "Just prior to discharge on 11-14 , pt 's BP was found to be 70/40 P70 s just after receiving her am BP meds .\n",
      "\n",
      "She was asymptomatic .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was kept in the hospital and the following issues were addressed :\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .\n",
      "\n",
      "Infection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .\n",
      "\n",
      "Her groin exam was unchanged .\n",
      "\n",
      "Her Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .\n",
      "\n",
      "Repeat hcts were stable .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .\n",
      "\n",
      "As volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .\n",
      "\n",
      "She was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .\n",
      "\n",
      "She tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .\n",
      "\n",
      "She will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .\n",
      "\n",
      "She was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .\n",
      "\n",
      "3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Stool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .\n",
      "\n",

      "There is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .\n",

      "We have advised a BRAT diet .\n",
      "\n",
      "4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .\n",

      "However , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Robert Mackey is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a history of peripheral neuropathy , kidney transplantation in 2003 secondary to diabetic nephropathy , as well as throat cancer in 2004 treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation .\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr.  Mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at C5-C6 , less so at C4-C5 , with clear cut cord compression , particularly on the right side C5-C6 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore , he was admitted for C4-C5 and C5-C6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion .\n",
      "\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "\n",
      "Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees ; blood pressure 145/80 ; pulse 60 ; respiratory rate 10 ; 100% on a non-rebreather .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was awake , alert , uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site .\n",
      "\n",
      "The wounds were clean , dry and intact , and flat .\n",
      "\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "\n",
      "While in the PACU , Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO2 dropped to 89% .\n",
      "\n",
      "His respiratory rate was 30 on face mask .\n",
      "\n",
      "Interoperatively , he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate , although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively .\n",
      "\n",
      "He responded to intravenous Lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement .\n",
      "\n",
      "The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume .\n",
      "\n",
      "No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia , although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was also put on Lopressor 150 mg twice a day .\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in the Intensive Care Unit , O2 saturation was closely monitored .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient became agitated with both tent and Bi-PAP machine , although continued to saturate well .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was transferred to Medicine the morning of 2010-08-30 , for continued medical management post surgery .\n",
      "\n",
      "On the day of transfer , the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus , a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants .\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .\n",
      "\n",
      "2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :\n",
      "\n",
      "Mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .\n",
      "\n",
      "Finger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Infectious causes were evaluated .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .\n",
      "\n",
      "A lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .\n",
      "\n",
      "A head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .\n",
      "\n",
      "No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .\n",
      "\n",
      "This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Trauma was also considered .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .\n",
      "\n",
      "Liver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .\n",
      "\n",
      "TSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .\n",
      "\n",
      "RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .\n",
      "\n",
      "The assay was nonreactive .\n",
      "\n",
      "An EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .\n",
      "\n",
      "On the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .\n",
      "\n",
      "Security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point\n",
      "\n",
      "restraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .\n",
      "\n",
      "The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Later in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .\n",
      "\n",
      "They were taken off two at a time .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .\n",
      "\n",
      "Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .\n",
      "\n",
      "haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .\n",
      "\n",
      "Each progressive day,  Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .\n",
      "\n",
      "The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .\n",
      "\n",
      "Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .\n",
      "\n",
      "His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .\n",
      "\n",
      "With this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .\n",
      "\n",
      "While the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .\n",
      "\n",
      "As for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .\n",
      "\n",
      "The only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :\n",
      "\n",
      "Soreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .\n",
      "\n",
      "This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .\n",
      "\n",

      "He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .\n",
      "\n",
      "This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .\n",
      "\n",
      "In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .\n",
      "\n",
      "A workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .\n",
      "\n",
      "According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .\n",
      "\n",
      "About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .\n",
      "\n",
      "He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .\n",
      "\n",
      "He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .\n",
      "\n",
      "An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .\n",

      "There was evidence of cord compression .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .\n",
      "\n",
      "However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .\n",
      "\n",
      "He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .\n",

      "These findings were consistent with the cord compression .\n",
      "\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "\n",
      "By problems -\n",
      "\n",
      "1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .\n",
      "\n",
      "Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .\n",
      "\n",
      "There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\n",
      "\n",
      "The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .\n",
      "\n",
      "Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .\n",
      "\n",
      "He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .\n",
      "\n",
      "These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .\n",
      "\n",
      "Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .\n",
      "\n",
      "The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .\n",
      "\n",
      "2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .\n",
      "\n",
      "An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .\n",
      "\n",
      "3) ONCOLOGY :\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .\n",
      "\n",
      "4) NEUROLOGIC :\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.\n",
      "\n",
      "His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .\n",
      "\n",
      "His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .\n",
      "\n",
      "His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .\n",
      "\n",
      "5) BLOOD SUGARS :\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .\n",
      "\n",
      "6) RESPIRATORY :\n",
      "\n",
      "He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\n",
      "\n",
      "However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\n",
      "\n",
      "He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\n",
      "\n",
      "7) NUTRITION :\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\n",
      "\n",
      "He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .\n",
      "\n",
      "8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\n",
      "\n",
      "His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\n",
      "\n",
      "He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .\n",

      "In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\n",

      "\n",
      "He was given supplemental oxygen .\n",
      "\n",

      "However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\n",
      "\n",
      "On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\n",
      "\n",
      "He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\n",
      "\n",
      "Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\n",
      "\n",
      "However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\n",

      "\n",
      "No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\n",
      "\n",
      "He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\n",
      "\n",
      "However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\n",

      "Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\n",

      "The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\n",
      "\n",
      "These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\n",

      "\n",
      "Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .\n",
